**MAJOR MILESTONE**: LegacyBridge now has enterprise-grade testing infrastructure! 🎉

**Must Read Documents:**
- legacy-bridge-description.md (enterprise solution requirements)
- claude.md (project rules and conventions)
- LEGACYBRIDGE_BUILD_SPEC_2.md (complete specification)
- NEW_AGENT_BUILD_PROMPT_2.md (build methodology)
- HANDOFF_LOG.md (current session - this document)

**Current Achievement Summary:**
- ✅ **Complete Document Processing Pipeline** implemented and deployed
- ✅ **Enterprise Testing Infrastructure** with 90% coverage requirement
- ✅ **Beautiful modern UI** with comprehensive component tests
- ✅ **Robust Rust backend** with integration test coverage
- ✅ **E2E testing** covering complete user workflows
- ✅ **33/41 tasks complete** (80% done - major progress!)

**Testing Infrastructure Status:**
The project now has production-ready testing with:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Complete workflow testing including pipeline processing
- **E2E Tests**: Real browser testing of user interactions and accessibility
- **Performance Tests**: Timing and speed validation
- **Cross-browser Tests**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Mobile viewports
- **Coverage Enforcement**: 90% threshold with detailed reporting

**Remaining High Priority Tasks (Critical Path):**
1. **MD→RTF Conversion** - Implement reverse conversion with pipeline support
2. **32-bit DLL Export** - Create VB6/VFP9 compatible library
3. **Legacy Integration** - VB6/VFP9 examples and GetLastError system
4. **Settings Panel** - Implement the tested but missing settings component
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Add real-time performance tracking tools

**Testing Commands Available:**
```bash
npm run test              # Run unit and integration tests
npm run test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
npm run test:e2e          # Run E2E tests with Playwright
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Run E2E tests with visual interface
npm run test:all          # Run complete test suite
```

**Git Repository:**
- **Branch**: `terragon/continue-from-last-agent` 
- **Status**: Ready for continued development
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite ready for development

**Workflow to Use:**
1. Use TodoWrite to update the master todo list (current status above)
2. Focus on MD→RTF conversion implementation as highest priority
3. Use TDD approach - tests are already written, implement the functionality
4. Run `npm run test:watch` during development for immediate feedback
5. Ensure all tests pass before committing changes
6. Update this HANDOFF_LOG.md when session is complete

**Tools to Use:**
- Multiple agents in parallel for different high-priority tasks
- Sequential thinking for complex problems
- Context7 MCP Server for deep research
- zen-mcp-server, gemini-mcp-server if stuck and need "ultrathinking"
- TodoWrite for task management (CRITICAL)

The testing infrastructure is now enterprise-ready! The next agent should focus on implementing the MD→RTF conversion functionality using the existing pipeline architecture.

3. **Error Recovery** - Six strategies for handling malformed RTF
4. **Template System** - Enterprise templates with variable substitution

**Workflow to Use:**
1. Use TodoWrite to check and update the master todo list
2. The pipeline is now the PRIMARY conversion method
3. Use multiple agents in parallel for different tasks

## Session 001 - 2025-07-24 15:00 - 2 hours

### Completed This Session:
- ✅ Initialized Next.js + Tauri project with exact specifications - 20min
- ✅ Set up shadcn/ui components and theme system - 25min
- ✅ Researched RTF format specification and created comprehensive documentation - 15min
- ✅ Implemented basic RTF parser in Rust with lexer and parser - 30min
- ✅ Created Markdown generator for RTF→MD conversion - 10min
- ✅ Built beautiful DragDropZone component with Framer Motion animations - 15min
- ✅ Created ConversionProgress component with detailed file tracking - 10min
- ✅ Connected Tauri frontend to Rust backend with file I/O - 15min

### Current Status:
- 🔄 Core RTF→Markdown conversion is working (basic formatting)
- 🔄 Beautiful UI is ready with drag-drop and progress tracking
- ⏸️ Tauri build blocked by JavaScriptCore version mismatch (system issue)

### Next Session Priorities:
1. Set up testing infrastructure (Playwright + Vitest)
2. Implement MD2Rtf conversion function
3. Add more RTF features (tables, lists, fonts, colors)
4. Write comprehensive unit tests for parser
5. Create error handling system (GetLastError)
6. Build SettingsPanel component

### Technical Decisions Made:
- Used token-based RTF parser with state machine - provides flexibility for complex RTF
- Implemented streaming approach for large files - better memory efficiency
- Used Zustand for state management - simpler than Redux for this use case
- Base64 encoding for file transfer between frontend/backend - handles binary data safely
- shadcn/ui for all UI components - consistent, professional look

### Issues/Blockers:
- JavaScriptCore version mismatch (system has 4.1, Tauri expects 4.0) - can be resolved with Docker or correct environment
- Need to implement more RTF control codes for full compatibility

### Files Modified:
- Created entire project structure from scratch
- src/components/DragDropZone.tsx
- src/components/ConversionProgress.tsx
- src-tauri/src/conversion/rtf_parser.rs
- src-tauri/src/conversion/rtf_lexer.rs

   - gemini-mcp-server
   - consult7-mcp-server
4. Work in 30-60 minute chunks on single tasks
5. Test everything with Playwright
